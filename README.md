Generating a password for a secured code
I called var for the lowercase, uppercase, numbers ,and the special symbols,
then add the prompt to have the value up display on the screen after calling the function key.

I added the if and else if statement to call the function of the keys.

and the confirm button to see the display on the screen and follow the function

I use the concat to add the value of together, the password lenght 

and the for loops also to add the figure ++ together and generating new keys
